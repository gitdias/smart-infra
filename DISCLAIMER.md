**Attention Notice and Risk Disclaimer**

The **Smart-Infra** project, developed as a comprehensive technological solution, was built and validated exclusively in controlled laboratory environments. During its development, rigorous coding practices and automated testing were implemented to ensure functional integrity and operational stability within the limits of the simulated environment.

However, when using **Smart-Infra** in real-world production scenarios or uncontrolled environments, it is imperative that the source code be carefully reviewed and audited by qualified professionals. It is strongly recommended to conduct a detailed assessment of the system's suitability for the specific conditions of the target environment, including but not limited to:

1. **Compatibility with existing infrastructure**: Verify the interoperability between **Smart-Infra** and legacy systems, virtualization platforms, frameworks, and APIs used in your environment.
2. **Security and compliance**: Perform security audits to identify potential vulnerabilities, ensuring that the system complies with applicable regulatory standards and governance policies.
3. **Performance and scalability**: Evaluate the impact of using **Smart-Infra** under different workloads and traffic scenarios to ensure it meets expected performance requirements.
4. **Operational risks**: Consider the potential side effects on critical business processes and implement monitoring and contingency mechanisms to mitigate unexpected failures.

By integrating **Smart-Infra** into a production environment, you assume full responsibility for all associated risks, including possible operational disruptions, data loss, security breaches, or financial impacts resulting from its implementation. This project is provided "as-is," without any expressed or implied warranties of any kind, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement.

To minimize risks, it is recommended to follow best software engineering practices, including incremental versioning, regression testing, and the adoption of robust CI/CD pipelines. Additionally, maintain consistent backups and document all changes made to the original code.

Please carefully read the technical documentation provided and consult the support team, if necessary, before proceeding with implementation.

**WARNING:** Improper or negligent use of **Smart-Infra** may result in unpredictable adverse consequences. Ensure that all necessary precautions have been taken before deploying the system.

_Sincerely,_  
The Smart-Infra Development Team
